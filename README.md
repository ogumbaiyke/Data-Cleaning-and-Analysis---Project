# Data Cleaning and Analysis with Excel - Mini Project


### Objective
The task is to clean and analyze the given dataset. This exercise will boost your data cleaning techniques and perform basic exploratory data analysis.

### Instructions:

1. Remove Duplicate IDs - Ensure that each ID in the dataset is unique by identifying and removing and dupicate entries.
2. Handle Infinite Values - Identify and drop any rows where the Price Per Unit column contains 'inf', as these values are not valid for analysis
3. Regional Analysis - Calculate the total quantity sold and total value (Quantity * Price Per Unit) for each region. Present your findings in a structured summary.


### Expected Deliverables:

* A cleaned dataset with duplicate IDs removed and infinite values handled.
* A summary table showing total quantity and total value per region.
* A short report explaining your steps and insights from the cleaned data.
